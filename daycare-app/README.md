## Description

This is a very basic application in which we can see a list of children in a daycare center. For each child we display a profile picture, full name, birthday and status (checked in or checked out). Two buttons are assigned to each child, for checkin and checkout respectively. If the status of the child is "checked in", only the checkout button is enabled. Similarly, if the status of the child is "checked out", only the checkin button is enabled.

The main purpose of this application is to be able to use the provided APIs for getting a list of children, checking in and checking out children.

## Future improvements 

- Be able to select a pickup time when checking in (right now the pickup time is hardcoded).
- Better UI (the focus in this assignment was not in UI).
- Write tests.
